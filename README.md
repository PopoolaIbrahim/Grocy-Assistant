Across Africa, millions of small retail shop owners still rely on manual methods for inventory, billing, and customer interaction. GrocyAI is an offline, AI-enabled mobile application designed to transform how grocery shops operate, especially in low-connectivity areas. It harnesses computer vision and conversational AI to deliver a smarter, faster, and more efficient retail experience.

GrocyAI empowers store owners to manage inventory and customer transactions through a seamless barcode scanning system using their smartphone camera. By simply scanning product barcodes, users can quickly add items to their store database or scan purchased items at checkout. The app connects to receipt printers via Bluetooth to issue physical receipts instantly — all without needing an internet connection.
Beyond scanning, GrocyAI includes a conversational assistant that interacts with the user, providing help with daily tasks like managing product stock, generating sales summaries, or answering common inventory-related questions. This makes it intuitive and accessible, even for users with limited technical experience.
Our focus is to make retail tech inclusive. GrocyAI’s offline-first design ensures it is usable in underserved communities where internet access is unreliable or expensive. Its integration of AI and Bluetooth-enabled receipt printing delivers functionality typically found only in high-end, internet-connected Point-of-Sale (POS) systems — now available on a low-cost mobile device.

Key Features:
Offline-first design: Full functionality without internet access.


Camera-based barcode scanning: Add and sell products easily.


AI assistant (GrocyAI): Natural language interaction for business insights.


Bluetooth receipt printer: Fast and seamless billing.


Lightweight and user-friendly UI for mobile phones.


By building GrocyAI, we aim to close the tech gap for local shop owners, boost digital inclusion, and unlock smarter retail experiences across Africa — starting with the smallest stores. With the right support, we envision expanding GrocyAI to support voice in local languages, integrate mobile payment systems, and deploy across multiple African countries.
